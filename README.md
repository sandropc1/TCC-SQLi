# TCC-SQLi

This repository contains the source code of the web application developed for my **Bachelor's thesis in Computer Engineering** for **UTFPR**.  
The project focuses on studying **SQL Injection (SQLi)** vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, providing a foundation for understanding how they work, how they can be exploited, and what strategies can be applied to mitigate them.

---

## üìå Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to simulate a vulnerable web application where SQL Injection attacks can be reproduced safely.  
This application was designed exclusively for **educational and research purposes**, supporting the analysis of:
- SQL Injection exploitation techniques
- Detection and prevention methods
- Evaluation of security tools

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **PHP** ‚Äì server-side logic
- **MySQL** ‚Äì database management
- **Docker & Docker Compose** ‚Äì containerized deployment
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** ‚Äì front-end interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sandropc1/TCC-SQLi.git
   cd TCC-SQLi

2. Start the Docker environment:
   ```bash    
   docker-compose up -d

3. Access the application in your browser:
